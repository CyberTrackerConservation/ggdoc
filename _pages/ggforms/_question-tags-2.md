## Start and End time
Start time is the time when the user pressed the `+` button to create a new observation. 
End time is the time when the user last pressed the save button.

**Note that these are hidden questions, so the user will not see them.**

### Example
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/q_startend_1.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/q_startend_2.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

**Note**
1. Start and End times use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). This is the local time + time zone offset. 
2. The `Timestamp` column is the time when the observation was received by the server
